	<h1>Creating an AWS Cloud9 Environment</h1>
	<p>This guide provides instructions for creating an AWS Cloud9 development environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>An AWS account</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console</h2>
	<p>Log in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials. If you don't have an AWS account, you can sign up for one on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS website</a>.</p>
	<h2>Step 2: Create a new Cloud9 Environment</h2>
	<p>Once you have logged in, go to the Cloud9 console by clicking on the Services menu and selecting Cloud9 under the Developer Tools category. Then click on the Create environment button. </p>
	<h2>Step 3: Configure the Environment</h2>
	<p>On the Create environment page, configure your environment as desired. You can choose the name and description for your environment, as well as the instance type, and environment settings. Make sure to choose the EC2 instance type that meets your requirements. Once you have made your selections, click on the Create environment button to proceed.</p>
	<h2>Step 4: Wait for the Environment to be created</h2>
	<p>It may take a few minutes for the environment to be created. You will be redirected to the Cloud9 IDE once the environment is ready. </p>
	<h2>Step 5: Start using the Environment</h2>
	<p>Your Cloud9 environment is now ready to use. You can start coding, running commands, and deploying applications right from the Cloud9 IDE. Enjoy!</p>
